# Smart Playlist Creator
Small project to begin studying Machine Learning concepts by creating a website to recommend music for the user in interactive, creative ways.

The initial scope of this project is to recommend music based off songs in my playlist using the kaggle spotify music database. I will be using a recommender system using clustering algorithms and other machine learning concepts. After the initial music portion, I intend to continue the project by allowing recommendations in other online media such as movies, TV, and anime.
