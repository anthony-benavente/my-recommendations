# Smart Playlist Creator
Small project to begin studying Machine Learning concepts by creating a website to recommend music for the user in interactive, creative ways.

The initial scope of this project is to recommend music based off songs in my playlist using the kaggle spotify music database. I will be using a recommender system using clustering algorithms and other machine learning concepts. After the initial music portion, I intend to continue the project by allowing recommendations in other online media such as movies, TV, and anime.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
